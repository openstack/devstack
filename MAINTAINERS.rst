MAINTAINERS

Overview
--------

The following is a list of people known to have interests in
particular areas or sub-systems of devstack.

It is a rather general guide intended to help seed the initial
reviewers list of a change.  A +1 on a review from someone identified
as being a maintainer of its affected area is a very positive flag to
the core team for the veracity of the change.

The ``devstack-core`` group can still be added to all reviews.
