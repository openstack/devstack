localrc User settings
---------------------

``localrc`` is the old file used to configure DevStack. It is deprecated
and has been replaced by ```local.conf`` <local.conf.html>`__. DevStack
will continue to use ``localrc`` if it is present and ignore the
``localrc`` section in ``local.conf.``. Remove ``localrc`` to switch to
using the new file.
