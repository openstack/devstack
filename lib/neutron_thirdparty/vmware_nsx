# VMware NSX
# ----------

# This third-party addition can be used to configure connectivity between a DevStack instance
# and an NSX Gateway in dev/test environments. In order to use this correctly, the following
# env variables need to be set (e.g. in your localrc file):
#
# * enable_service vmware_nsx        --> to execute this third-party addition
# * PUBLIC_BRIDGE                    --> bridge used for external connectivity, typically br-ex
# * NSX_GATEWAY_NETWORK_INTERFACE    --> interface used to communicate with the NSX Gateway
# * NSX_GATEWAY_NETWORK_CIDR         --> CIDR to configure br-ex, e.g. 172.24.4.211/24

# Save trace setting
MY_XTRACE=$(set +o | grep xtrace)
set +o xtrace

# This is the interface that connects the Devstack instance
# to an network that allows it to talk to the gateway for
# testing purposes

# Re-declare floating range as it's needed also in stop_vmware_nsx, which
# is invoked by unstack.sh
