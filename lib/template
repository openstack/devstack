# lib/template
# Functions to control the configuration and operation of the XXXX service
# <do not include this template file in ``stack.sh``!>

# Dependencies:
# ``functions`` file
# ``SERVICE_{TENANT_NAME|PASSWORD}`` must be defined
# <list other global vars that are assumed to be defined>

# ``stack.sh`` calls the entry points in this order:
#
# install_XXXX
# configure_XXXX
# init_XXXX
# start_XXXX
# stop_XXXX
# cleanup_XXXX

# Print the commands being run so that we can see the command that triggers
# an error.  It is also useful for following along as the install occurs.
set -o xtrace


# Defaults
# --------

# <define global variables here that belong to this project>
